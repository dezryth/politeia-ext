# politeia-ext

This is an extension for Google Chrome for users of Decred's proposal system. It allows you to store your Politeia Identity encrypted in your browser storage, which is synced among machines in which you are logged into your browser and syncing extensions. In the event your cookies are cleared, you can quickly retrieve your identity with the extension to re-import and continue participating in comments and discussion on proposals and other activities that require your identity key.

Anyone is welcome to contribute! I highly encourage review and feedback for improvement.
